            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Saint Paul greatly commendeth the holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(3)"/> Scriptures vnto vs, ſaying: The whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is giuen by inſpiration of God, and is profitable to teach, to improue, to correct and inſtruct in righteouſnes, that the man of God may bee abſolute, being made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vnto euery good worke. 2, Timoth: 3; 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>The Citizens of Beraea iudged of Pauls Sermons &amp; opinions out of the Scriptures; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(4)"/> whether Paul taught ſuch things, as were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the holy Scriptures; and are for that cauſe commended. Act: 17, 11.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt anſwered out of the Scriptures to the queſtions of the Phariſies. Matthew, 19, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(5)"/> 4, &amp;c. of the Sadducees. Matth, 22, 31, &amp;c. of the perfect fulfilling of the law. Luke, 10. 26, 27. of his diuinitie out of Pſalme, 110, Matthew, 22, 43, 44. Whereas hee might haue confuted and confounded them with his miracles alone.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles confirmed all their aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of the Scriptures, as did alſo the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(6)"/> Matthew ſpeaketh often of the fulfilling of the Prophets, and ſo decides the greateſt controuerſie, that euer was, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2051:6"/>
the Meſſias, out of the writings of the Prophets. So Peter alſo prooueth out of the holy Scripture, that Ieſus is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Meſſias, the Sauiour of the worlde. Acts, 2, 25, &amp;c. And Chapter, 3. verſe, 18, &amp;c. and Chapter, 4, verſe, 11, 25, &amp;c. and Chap. 10, verſe, 43, Stephen fighteth againſt his aduerſaries, the Prieſts, Phariſies, &amp; Scribes, with the weapons of the Scripture. Acts, 7. Paul in the controuerſie of Religion, which he had with the Iewes, prouokes to the law and the writings of the Prophets. Acts, 24, 14, and 26, 22, 27. The ſame Paul gathered the doctrine of Iuſtification out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Romanes, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10, Chapters. Galath. 3, and 4, Chapter: and cleareth the controuerſie of the perſon of our Sauiour out of the Scriptures. Epheſians, 4.

true Canon is the perpetuall rule of truth which is compriſed in the Scripture. For therfore falſe &amp; counterfaite bookes are not received, becauſe they contradict the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the truth, neither do agree with the authenticke &amp; Canonicall bookes. 3, And the Church of Chriſt could (for 300. yeares almoſt) diſcerne the true Scriptures fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the counterfaite, before the Fathers had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Canon, and catalogue of holy writte.

Neither yet is the Scripture for that cauſe to be accuſed of obſcuritie. 3. Over and beſides the greek text ſaith not, that either the Epiſtles of Saint Paul or the maner of his teaching, which he vſeth in his Epiſtles is obſcure; but only thus much it ſayth, that Paul doth intreate of, not onely ſuch things as are plaine and eaſie for everie one to conceive, but that he doth not

For the high Prieſt at that time was the higheſt Iudge, from whom no man might appeale. 2, It was not in the high Prieſts choiſe to judge as hee pleaſed, but hee was tyed to the lawe of the Lord, <hi>according to which</hi> he gave ſentence: In like ſort is the Popetyed to it too.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE word Tradition often times is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply taken for anie kinde of doctrine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be written or delivered by word of mouth. But by the name of Traditions are ſuch things alſo meant, which were not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten but onely delivered by word of mouth, and ſo have beene from hand to hand conveyed to our age: Theſe kinde of Traditions are of two ſorts: Some containe Ceremonies of nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and changeable according to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of place and time, which though they be not expreſſed in Scriptures, yet becauſe they are not contrarie to the ſame, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Church as things indifferent, are not called into queſtion. But there bee other ſorte of Traditions in Poperie, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2051:19"/>
to the Scriptures, and whereof there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares not ſo much as one ſtep in the Scriptures, (ſuch as are the Canon of the Maſſe, Holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſet number of prayers, holy Candells, and an infinite number more) which are comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to the World vnder the glorious name of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicke Traditions, to the obſerving whereof as being Apoſtolicke, all Chriſtians are bound, if wee will believe the Papiſts, The queſtion <note place="margin">The ſtate of the queſtion</note> then is. 1. Whether beſides the Scriptures the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles delivered ſome things by word of mouth only, 2, Whether they delivered thoſe things by word of mouth onely which at this day the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts bragg of as of, Apoſtolick Traditions. We deny both: the former wherof wee prove by the ſufficiencie of the holy Scripture, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines all things neceſſary to ſaluation. Whereof we have intreated before: the later wee prove by theſe reaſons following.</p>
               <p>Becauſe theſe their Traditions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(1)"/> to the Scriptures which we wil prove clearely hereafter. But we may not thinke that the Apoſtles writt ſome things, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by word of mouth other, and thoſe contrarie to their writings.</p>
               <p>Becauſe in Pauls time ſuch Traditions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(2)"/> to bee ſuſpected in the Church which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2051:19"/>
appeares by the words of S. Paul. 2. Theſſal, 2, 2. Be not ſuddenly moved from your mind nor troubled, neither by Spirit, nor by <hi>Worde</hi> nor by letter as ſent from vs.</p>
               <p>Becauſe it may be proved out of hiſtories, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(3)"/> that ſuch traditions had their firſt beginning ſome ages after the Apoſtles death. Wherof ſee in particular Polidor Virgill, eſpecially concerning the Canon of the Maſſe. <hi>de Inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerum lib,</hi> 5, <hi>cap,</hi> 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is proved by many &amp; manifeſt reaſons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(4)"/> that thoſe bookes and Canons, wherby they indevour to procure authority and credit to their Traditions, are forged and counterfaite (ſuch as are the Canons of the Apoſtles, the Decretalls, the Decrees of Popes, the books of Clement and Dyoniſius Areopagita. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do our aduerſaries doubt, but that many ſuch Canons &amp; bookes are counterfeits.</p>
               <p>Such Traditions of men are condemned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(5)"/> by the holy Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1, Becauſe they are in cauſe (as Chriſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth) that in the mean time the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God are neglected. Mat 15, 3:</p>
               <p n="2">2, Becauſe God is worſhipped in vaine by the doctrines and precepts of men, verſe, 9.</p>

                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:2051:20"/>
3. Becauſe the Traditions of men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach into the minde of God: for my thoughts are not as your thoughts, neither are your waies as my wayes (ſaith the Lord). For as the Heavens are higher than the earth ſo are my waies higher than your waies, and my thoughts above your thoughts. Iſay, 55, 8, 9. Whence it commeth to paſſe, that thoſe things which men admire for their ſingular holineſſe, do moſt of all diſpleaſe the Lord God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe ſuch plants as are not planted of the heavenly Father ſhall bee rooted out, Mat, 15, 13.</p>
               <p>Becauſe wee muſt rely our ſelues wholly on the Word of God, in worſhipping of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(6)"/> God, and that onely muſt we doe, which he hath commanded. Neither may we add, or diminiſh, anie thing there from, Deut, 12. 32 neither may we decline from the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God, either to the right hand or to the left, Deuter, 28, 14.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the Traditions of men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(7)"/> or trappes, Beware (ſayth Paul) leaſt there bee anie man that ſpoyle you through Philoſophie, and vaine <hi>deceite,</hi> through the

                  <p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2051:21"/>
Timothie deliuered not vnwritten verities, but thoſe things, which were decreed of the Apoſtles, and then comprized in writing, &amp; ſent to the Church of Antioch. The Papiſts therfore diſpute from a written to an vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Tradition.</p>
                  <p>(4) Paul ſaith, that hee deliuered certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to the Corinthians, which they did well that they obſerued them. 1, Corin. 11, 2.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ,</hi> There is great difference between the Councell of the Apoſtles and the Papall councels. In that there were witneſſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all exception, but in theſe, men do meet, among whom there bee many vnlearned, wicked, in parte Epicures, and ſuch as have ſworne homage to the Pope. In the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at Ieruſalem the decrees were made out of the Scripture, but the papall councells make conſtitutions very often againſt the Scripture. This is therefore a looſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>(2) In the councell of the Prieſts and Scribes, Caiaphas by the holy Ghoſt prophecied, that it was better that one ſhould dye for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than that all the people ſhould periſh. Ioh, 11, 50, Therefore Councells ſpeake by the holy Ghoſt, and are therefore to be obeyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Although Caiaphas vnnwittingly ſpake the truth, that that it was better that one man ſhould dye then all the people pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, yet the mind and meaning of Caiaphas was nothing ſo. But the definitiue ſentence of the High Prieſt and the Councell was,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2051:28"/>
that Chriſt was an hereticke, a blaſphemer, a ſeducer of the People; a wicked man, and ſuch as well deſerued the ſhamefull death of the croſſe. This was the decree of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; which if the Papiſts will ſubſcribe vnto, they ſhall bee reckoned impious, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Men. And by alleaging this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh councell they ſhall gaine ſmall credite to their owne, 2, This argument proceeds from a particular to an vniverſall, Caiaphas minding an other thing, and vnwittingly ſpoke a fewe true wordes, therefore all the decrees of their councells are ſimply in all thinges from the Holy Ghoſt, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in any caſe erre, 3. They might with as much truth and better reaſon conclude that Southſaiers, when they are ſought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to ſpeake for a rewarde cannot ſpeake an vntruth, Becauſe that Balaam being conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with of Balak to ſpeake againſt Iſrael, did on the contrarie ſide by inſpiration bleſſe them, and which is more then is ſayde of Caiaphas coulde not doe otherwiſe: and whereas the propheſie of Caiaphas was onely in his wordes, which hee ſpoke in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2051:29"/>
an other ſenſe, Balaams propheſie was both in his words and his meaning, Numb, 22, and 23.</p>

Otherwiſe in the time of Arrianiſme, the Apoſtolicke, CHVRCH as beeing brought to a great paucitie, ſhoulde not have beene the true and Catholicke Church; but the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould have been the Catholick Church for that they far exceeded in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the reſt, which were the true Chriſtians. In this ſence therefore wee deny the conſequence. The Antecedent alſo is not true, becauſe (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſayde) the Church of Rome doth not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2051:34"/>
conſent with the Church of the Apoſtles, nor yet with the Church of the Fathers. And therefore they haue not that vniuerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of multitude whereof they boaſt.</p>
                  <p>(5) If the Church of Rome bee not the true Church, then for ſome ages together Chriſt had beene without a ſpouſe, but Chriſt never was without a ſpouſe, Therefore, &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>An,</hi> 1. From a ſpeciall to a generall; argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are drawen only affirmatively. It is no good conſequence therefore; the church of Rome conſiſting of Popes, Cardinalls, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Prieſts, and others of the ſame ranke, who withſtood the heauenly truth, were not the ſpouſe of Chriſt, therefore Chriſt had no ſpouſe. 2. I deny the maior or firſt propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For there were alſo other Churches, as the Greeke Church, which alwaies gainſayd the Biſhop of Rome, and wherein Chriſt might haue his ſpouſe. The argument therefore proceedes from an inſufficient enumeration or reckoning vp of the parts to the whole. 3, In the viſible erronious Church of Rome, there was the ſpouſe of CHRIST hidden to the eye of the World (all glorious within Pſal, 45, 13) or the inuiſible companie of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuers.

                     <hi>Anſ,</hi> 1. This argument is too common, and agrees to both ſides. For by the ſame reaſon it may be proved, that the Papiſts are not the Church; becauſe their Church (which they cannot deny) hath much fallen away from the Church of the Fathers 2, the church of the Fathers is not the ſampler of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(5)"/> Churches, but the Church of the Apoſtles; to which it is ſufficient that our Church is like.</p>

For that ſame is the matter in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, 2. Our doctrine is not new, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, 3. There are therefore foure termes in the Argument. For in the Maior propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the worde <hi>Newe,</hi> is taken for that which is ſimply and altogether new: in the Minor, for the refined and renued miniſterie of the Word, reformed according to the rule of the moſt ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doctrine of the Prophets, Chriſt, and the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>(4) The Church ought to have vnitie, but ſo hath not the Church of the Proteſtants; for it is rent and devided into parts and ſchiſmes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1 Heere be foure termes. For in the Maior propoſition by the word Church are meant thoſe, which in truth and deede are the Church<hi>:</hi> in the minor thoſe which are in the outward company of the Church, or thoſe which have mingled themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our Church, when as in truth they be not of our opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: And theſe ſever them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from the true Church of them who maintaine the truth, and ſtirre vp Schiſmes.

for if they had been of vs, they would have continued with vs (1, Iohn 2, 19) 2, It is a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie taking that for a cauſe, which is not a cauſe.

                  <p>An. 1. There are heer foure terms: becauſe the Antecedent ſpeakes of the true Church, in which alone is Saluation to bee had, and which is the keeper of the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles: but the conſequent ſpeaketh of the Church of Rome, which is indeede the company and Church of Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. 2, It is a fallacie from that which is ſpoken but in ſome reſpect onely, to the ſame taken abſolutely. Becauſe the Church is the pillar and ground of <hi>truth;</hi> that is, ſo long as it maintaineth the truth, &amp; followes the direction of Gods word.

moſt exactly fullfilled, and ſecondarily to the Church, which holdeth the doctrine of the Apoſtles; ſuch as the Church of Rome is not at this day 2, It followeth not, the holy ghoſt was given to the Church, therefore the Church ſhall retaine it forever. Or the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was given to the Church, therefore the Church dooth alwaies follow the direction and guiding of the Spirit. For neither did Chriſt ſo promiſe his holy Spirit, that needs it muſt abide with the Church, howſoever the Church behaue it ſelfe, and turne aſide from the revealed Word of God. For ſo the Church of the Galatians coulde never haue been ſeduced.</p>
                  <p>(3) Chriſt prayed for the Church: Father, ſanctifie them with thy truth &amp;c, Ioh, 17, 17. therefore it cannot err.</p>

For Chriſt ſpeakes ſo, adding withall a condition: <hi>Thy Word is truth.</hi> Therefore this promiſe is tyed to the obſeruance of that worde, as to a certaine condition.</p>
                  <p>(4) My Spirit which is vpon thee, and my words, which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeede from henceforth for euermore, Iſai, 59, 21.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1 If this promiſe had beene made without condition, then it would follow that God had not kept his promiſe. For theſe words doe immediately goe before: They ſhall feare the name of the Lord from the Weſt, and his glory from the riſing of the ſunne, <hi>or the Eaſt:</hi> but the Eaſterne Churches have had a moſt miſerable downe-fall long agoe. This promiſe therefore is condtionall, as if God ſhould ſay, I will not forſake thee for ever, if thou forſake not me. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a fallacy from that which is ſpoken but in ſome reſpect to the ſame taken abſolutely. 2, This promiſe belongeth to the Church which obeieth the word of God, vnto which God will never be wanting with his ſpirit.</p>

               <p>THe Papiſts being driven from their holds, which have now beene treated of, doe flee to the authoritie of the Pope, as to a ſure &amp; ſacred anchor.

And that therefore whatſoeuer proceedes out of their mouth of any point of Religion muſt needes be infallibly true, and that all the faithfull or all Chriſtians are bound to obey them.

                  <p>2, Thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke I will build my Church. therefore Peter is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church; and thereupon hath power ouer the reſt.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is a fallacie of Compoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the Papiſts argument, thoſe thinges iointly are ſpoken of Peter, which Chriſt ſpoke diſtinctly, and ſeuerally of himſelfe &amp; of Peter. 2, Becauſe Chriſt ſpoke to all the Apoſtles vnder the perſon of Peter, it would follow (arguing as the Papiſts doe) that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of the Apoſtles was the Prince of the Apoſtles. Nowe what an abſurditie were this?</p>
                  <p>3, Chriſt ſaith to Peter, feede my <hi>ſheepe;</hi> &amp;c. Ioh: 21, 17. Therefore hee made him head of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>

2, Heere are foure termes: The word <hi>feede;</hi> in the Antecedent is to do the office of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Goſpell: but in the Conſequent it is to be a Prince, and to exerciſe domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>4, Chriſt payed tribute for Peter and not for the reſt of the Apoſtles, Matth: 17, 27, Therefore Peter was Prince of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>An. This is a Doctor like expoſition to pay tribute, that is, to make a Prince; for Peter, that is, Peter. Theſe dotages of the Papiſts declare, how abſurdly, for want of proofes, they ſcrape together any thing, to bleare the eies of the vnlearned.</p>
                  <p>5, Peter after the manner of a Prince lifted vp his voice on the day of Pentecoſt, when the reſt of the Apoſtles held their peace, as it were for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence ſake to him: Act: 2, 14, &amp; 4, 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a fallacie, putting that for a cauſe, which is not a cauſe, becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles might giue Peter this honour, either for his age, or eloquence, and not becauſe they acknowledged him for their Prince and head.</p>
                  <p>6, In the Counſell of the Apoſtles, Peter firſt of all gaue his voice: Act: 15, 7: Therefore he was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2051:48"/>
Prince of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1, The voice of Peter is deſcribed but whether he firſt of all gaue his voice, or ſome other before him, that is not written: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is more in the Conſequent, than in the Antecedent, on this wiſe. Peters voice is the firſt, that is mentioned, therefore no man gaue any voice before him. 2, It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth rather that others ſpake before him, by theſe words next going before. <hi>When there had been great diſputation, &amp;c.</hi> Whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that ſome had ſpoken their mindes before Peter. 3, out of this place it might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be proued, that Iames was the Prince of the Apoſtles; for that he, their voices being gathered, gaue the definitiue ſentence: the argument therefore of the Papiſts is moſt fond.</p>
                  <p>7. The Fathers and Writers of the Church haue acknowledged Peter to bee the Prince of the Apoſtles.</p>

In the Antecedent the keyes are taken for that part of the miniſtery, which conſiſteth in binding and looſing of ſinnes: in the conſequent it is miſtaken for authority to determine and conſtitute any thing what ſeemeth good in doctrine. 3 The keyes did not only belong to Peter, but to the reſt of the Apoſtles alſo; vnto whom Chriſt promiſed the keyes vnder the perſon of Peter, who had anſwered for all. And Chriſt gave authority <hi>alike to all</hi> to retaine &amp; to remit ſinnes, Mar, 18, 18, Ioh, 20, 23, which Panormitan alſo doth aduertiſe vs of.</p>

The Ieſuites in the Article of Iuſtification, doe expound the word Grace for a gift or habite infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into the ſoule of man from heauen, vvherby he is moved or ſtirred to worke righteouſly; and by the which his workes are accepted with God, and this Grace they deuide into the firſt and ſeconde Grace, or into a preventing Grace, (whereby a man may prepare himſelfe to the grace of Iuſtification) and a ſubſequent grace, (whereby a man is actually and habitually made iuſt) and ſo they goe about to ſhift of by this their explication, al the ſayings of the ſcripture concerning the free inſtification by faith.

meere particulars, and therefore no concluſion followes, 2. Whereas Saint Paul in that place treateth of miraculous gifts, not of iuſtification, and our queſtion is only of iuſtification; the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is frivolous, and not to the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: 3. Though wee denie not, but that the worde grace is ſometimes in Scripture taken figuratiuely for the free gifts of God beſtowed vpon men (for only we deny it to bee vſed in that ſignification in the article of Iuſtification any where in the Scripture) yet neither in this place alledged is the word <hi>Charis</hi> vſed, which properly ſignifieth grace, but <hi>Chariſma,</hi> which ſignifieth a gift freely beſtowed: and therefore the place is fitly and properly tranſlated. There are diuerſities of gifts.</p>
                  <p>2 Wee haue receiued grace for grace, Iohn 1, 16.</p>
                  <p>1 This is a Doctour like expoſition, made of their meere Doctour like authoritie, without reaſon: wee haue receiued grace, that is the grace of iuſtification: for grace, that is,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2051:72"/>
for the firſt preuenting grace, but the meaning of Saint Iohn is: becauſe the ſonne of God was in higheſt grace and fauour with his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father, therfore the father doth embrace vs alſo with his grace and louing kindneſſe for his ſonnes ſake, in whom we beleeue. 2. That grace in this place is oppoſed vnto merites, the wordes next following doe declare: for the law was giuen by Moſes, but grace and truth came by Ieſus Chriſt; Heere Chriſt and Moſes are oppoſed betwixt themſelues, as it were in the proper differences of their offices, that is of wrath by the lawe and of grace by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
                  <p>3 Grace is the gift of God, Epheſ. 2. 8. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is an infuſed and inherent habite.</p>

                     <hi>Anſwere,</hi> 1: It is a fallacie of compoſition and diuiſion, ariſing from the conſtruction of the words, for the word gift is not ſimplie and alone conſtrued with the word grace, but with ſaluation by grace, which if it might ſhould haue been expreſſed in one word. Brieffely &amp; plainely, the Apoſtle ſaith not, Grace is the gift of God, but that ye are ſaued by grace, that is the gift of God, 2 and for the ſame cauſe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2051:72"/>
the gift in this place is not a habite, for gift is oppoſed there to workes and merites, as being a thing, that is beſtowed of meere fauour.</p>
                  <p>4 It is a good thing that the hart be eſtabliſhed with grace: Heb, 13, 9<hi>:</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwere,</hi> 1: It is a begging of the queſtion; becauſe this is controuerſed, whether Grace doe in theſe wordes ſignifie an infuſed habite, 2. In that very place the Apoſtle oppoſeth Grace to the vaine confidence of workes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them who put confidence in meates, drinkes &amp;c. Therefore by the nature of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it appeareth, that the worde grace is heere taken for the free fauour and mercy of God, &amp; ſo the argument hangeth not together, for in the Antecedent Grace is taken for the fauour of God, in the conſequent for an infuſed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite.</p>

                  <p>1 Faith is the gift of God: but the gifts of God are qualities: therefore faith is a qualitie.</p>

2, The Apoſtles taught their hearers to beleeue not abſolutely, without reference to Chriſt, but to beleeue in Chriſt, in whom they were bid to beleeue, and to be baptized in his name. Matt, 28, 19,</p>
                  <p>3 Faith is a worke, Iohn 6: 29: therfore it iuſtifies, as a worke.</p>

This (how it is to be conſidered) Chriſt declareth in the words next following: This is the worke of God, that yee beleeue in him (See there is the relatiue or reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectiue acception) whome he hath ſent. 2, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in this argument, there is more in the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluſion, than in the premiſſes: for the collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they make, is ſuch like, as this, faith is in ſome ſorte a worke, therefore it iuſtifieth as a worke.</p>

Likewiſe, the holy Ghoſt ſhall glorifie Chriſt, Iohn, 16, 14: but theſe ſervices doe obſcure Chriſt with his merites. 3, Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may wee impute that to the Church of Chriſt, whatſoeuer certaine ſuperſtitious men haue broached vnder the title and name of the Church; bringing heereby the true Church of Chriſt into bondage, and vexing them with the obſervation of mens traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>3. Chriſt ſaith of his Apoſtles, he that heareth you, heareth mee. (Luke. 10. 16.) therefore it is
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2051:106"/>
all one, as if Chriſt had deliuered thoſe ſeruices of God with his owne mouth.</p>

What agreement is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Chriſt and Belial? betweene the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and the Prelates of the Roman Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt? 2, It is a fallacie of diuiſion, becauſe thoſe neceſſarie words, which are part of the inſtruction that Chriſt gaue to his Apoſtles, are omitted, to wit, teach them to obſerue whatſoeuer <hi>I haue commanded</hi> you. Matthew 28.</p>
                  <p>4 As the doctrine of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes ſitting in the chaire of Moſes, was approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſo the conſtitutions of the Prelates of the Church, concerning the ſeruice of God, are to be approued and ratified.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1, To ſit in Moſes chaire, is not to frame new deuiſes of GODS ſeruice, but to teach MOSES. It is therefore a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie from that, which is ſpoken in ſome reſpecte onely to the ſame taken abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in all reſpectes. For then the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes fate in Moſes chaire, when they taught the law of Moſes; but not when they broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſuperſtitious and falſe conceits, wherof Chriſt ſaide. Beware of the leauen of the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2051:107"/>
Phariſes, meaning their doctrine (Matth 16, 6, 12) 2. There is more in the concluſion, than in the premiſſes. For there followeth no more, but this, that the Miniſters of Chriſt, that teach well and liue ill, are to bee heard, if in the meane while they teach that which is truth. But what is this to the purpoſe?</p>
                  <p>5 Manie things are held and defended in the Church (that is of Rome) which are not in the Scriptures.</p>

                  <p>6 There are in the moſt auncient Councels, which are approved and allowed on both parts, conſtitutions, which are not compriſed in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but are receiued as being de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ,</hi> 1, Theſe conſtitutions belong to order and comelineſſe, and are not matters of faith. Therfore this is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. 2, Neither are they propoſed by the Councells as meritorious of eternall life, but as things indifferent. 3 And in Councells,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2051:107"/>
which wee approue of, wee receiue thoſe things onely, which are not contrarie to the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>7 Chriſt never commanded to abſtaine from that which is ſtrangled, which notwithſtanding the Apoſtles commanded, Acts. 15, 29. Nay they were abrogated, and afterward brought vp by the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a fallacie from that which is ſpoken in ſome reſpect to the ſame taken ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and in all reſpects. For the Apoſtles did not require this, as a thing neceſſarie to ſaluation, but did ordaine in ſome reſpect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of charitie in favour of the weake ones, who might bee offended at Chriſtian libertie vſed vnſeaſonably. But the Papiſts contend for ſuch conſtitutions, as they make neceſſarie. It is therefore an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from that, which is neceſſarie by an accident and ſpeciall occaſion, to that which is of it ſelfe abſolutely neceſſarie.</p>

5 There bee in the Scriptures examples of perfect men: as, Hezekiah walked with a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> heart. 2. King, 20. 3, the heart of Aſah the King was <hi>perfect.</hi> 2. Chron. 15, 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw,</hi> 1, Perfection there is oppoſed vnto hipocriſie. It is therefore perfection not abſolutely, but in ſome reſpect 2. This perfection of thoſe Kings was imperfecte, For Hezekiah is in the ſame Chapter accuſed of ſinne, and the puniſhments for ſinne are denounced againſt him. And of Aſah it is recorded, that he caſt the prophet of the Lord into priſon, and that he truſted more in the helpe of the Phiſitians, than in the Lord, &amp;c, It is then a bad ſequele, to conclude from perfection in ſome reſpect and ſort, to abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perfection, which is without all ſpot.</p>
                  <p>6 Zacharie and Elizabeth were both iuſt, and walked in all the Commandements and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Lord without reproue, Luke 1. 6</p>
                  <p>Anſ, 1. It followeth not, they are ſayde to bee iuſte: therefore they are ſayd to be iuſt by the workes and perfecte fulfilling of the

For Zacharie ſinned through vnbeliefe, and therefore was made dumbe. Therfore this reaſon is many waies faultie.</p>

                  <p>8 The regenerate are called perfect. Let vs, as manie as be perfect, be thus minded. Philip, 3, 15. Among them that are perfect, 1, Corin, 2, 6, The Scripture maketh a man perfect, 2, Timoth, 3, 17.</p>
                  <p>Anſ, 1, Paul ſpeaketh of them, which do acknowledge Chriſt, not hypocritically, but truly, and are inflamed, not with an hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, but with a true zeale of amending their life, and he ſpeakes of ſuch a perfection, as
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2051:116"/>
befalleth the Saints of God, who yet carie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with them the corrupt fleſh. There are therefore foure termes; ſeeing that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this argument is taken two manner of waies, firſt for ſinceritie oppoſed to hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and then for abſolute and full perfection in everie point. 2, As concerning the place, <note place="margin">For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the law is holy, the law is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſinners. Therefore ſinners al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are holy</note> (2. Timoth, 3, 17.) the Scripture containeth perfect inſtruction of a holy life. But it doth not hereof follow, that the regenerate are perfect. For no man liueth in all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of the Scripture.</p>

Anſ. 1, By this reaſon all married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, euen the infidels ſhould bee ſaued. 2, Paul comforteth women; that their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes which GOD layeth vpon them for a puniſhment, do turne to them to bee offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their calling, &amp; exerciſes of the croſſe, of a Sacrament neuer a word, 3 Paul ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon ſuppoſition and with limitation; If they continue in faith, &amp;c.

                  <p>4 The vnbeleeuing husband is ſanctified by the Wife. 1, Cor. 7, 14 Seeing therfore Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie hath the power of ſanctifying, it is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                  <p>Anſw. 1. If this ſanctifying heere ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, pertaine to ſaluation, then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that infidels ſhall bee ſaued by their belieuing wines; which is abſurde; but if

                  <p>5 Matrimonie hath his inſtitution &amp; bleſſing from God, Gen. 2, 18, 22, 24. Therefore it is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. That promiſe of bleſſing is not of the grace of iuſtification and reconciliation, but onely of a temporall felicitie.

               <p>Becauſe there be other meanes of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(2)"/> vnion, than by Tranſſubſtantiation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: as is apparent in Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſaith not; This ſhall bee made my body; or this is changed into my body: but, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(3)"/> This is my body; to wit, by ſacramentall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and vnion, as in other Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Paul, the heavenly Interpreter of Chriſts words, doth not admit Tranſſubſtantiation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(4)"/> but doth ſo interprete the ſacramentall vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſtil the viſible elements remaine, or the bread of the Sacrament after the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, hee calleth bread ſtill: to giue vs to vnderſtand, that the ſubſtance of the bread remaineth ſtill.</p>
               <p n="1">1, The bread (ſaith he) which we breake (that is, diſtribute after the conſecration) is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt. 1, Cor. 10. 16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All we are partakers of one bread. 1. Corinth: 10. 16.</p>

               <p n="5">5. Let a man examine himſelfe, and ſo let him eate of this bread. verſe, 28.</p>
               <p>So haue the Fathers explaned this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that they declare, that the elements re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(5)"/>: as, Receaue that in the bread (ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually by faith) which hanged vppon the Croſſe.

               <p>Theſe manner of ſpeaches in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are almoſt alike: God is man: This is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(6)"/> my beloved ſonne.

               <p>Vpon the opinion of Tranſſubſtantiation many abſurdities doe follow. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(7)"/>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1, So Chriſt ſhould be ſaid to haue a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold body or two bodies; whereof the one

                  <p>3 The worde (eſt, is) is a verbe ſubſtantiue, which noteth a beeing, or ſubſiſting; therefore there muſt needes be Tranſſubſtantiation.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. 1, By the ſame reaſon, it will as well follow: Chriſt ſaith, I am a vine; but the verbe (<hi>ſam</hi> or I am) is a verbe ſubſtantiue, which noteth the beeing and ſubſiſting of a thing. Therefore there muſt needes bee Tranſſubſtantiation of Chriſts nature into a vine. 2, It ſignifieth the beeing, but not the manner of the being. There is Chriſts body indeed, but not after a naturall manner of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Tranſſubſtantiation, but after a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall by faith and ſacramentall vnion.</p>

4 There muſt needes bee an Identitie, that the body may truly be predicated of the breade: (for it were not true that breade remaining the ſame, and a different thing from the body ſhould be the body:) but an Identitie of the breade and body can bee no other way made, but by Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. There needes no Identitie to make the predication true: for this propoſition is true, the Lambe is the Paſſeouer, and yet the Lambe and the Paſſeouer bee not the ſame thing. For ſome things are affirmed of other, becauſe they are really &amp; formally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in them: &amp; ſome things again are affir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med of other, becauſe they haue an externall vnion and coherence, which is moſt vſuall in all the ſacramental ſpeeches both of the old &amp; new Teſtament.

                  <p>5 As that predication is vnderſtood (Matth, 3) This is my beloued Sonne, that is, whatſoeuer ye ſee; is my beloued Sonne: ſo are the wordes of Chriſt to be vnderſtood in the ſupper: as, This is my body, that is, that which yee ſee, is my body.

                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> 1, Howſoeuer the predicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be vnderſtood (Matthew, 3,) the contrarie will rather follow thereof. For by reaſon of the neare coniunction of the two natures in Chriſt, the one is predicated of the other in Concreto, but there is no Tranſſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or changing of one nature into the other. 2, Chriſt was the Sonne of God both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his deitie and of his humanitie. And therefore this ſpeach is nothing like thoſe of the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>6 Seeing that the predication is changed (ſo that the breade is afterward not called bread, but the Lords bodie) it muſt needes bee that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect; (that whereof it is ſpoken) muſt bee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged alſo, &amp; therefore there is Tranſſubſtantiation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> There is a great change, but it is of vſe and qualitie, not of ſubſtance. Therefore after the conſecration it is called bleſſed and holy breade, the communion of the body of Chriſt, and is not common vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar breade.

7 Tropes and figures are not to bee admitted in the wordes of the ſupper.

                  <p>1 Breade, after the phraſe of the Hebrues, is often taken for nouriſhment, ſo whereas the body of Chriſt is the nouriſhment of the ſoule, it may well be called breade by Paul, euen after the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.</p>
                  <p>Anſ, It followeth not, breade in ſome places ſignifieth nouriſhment; therefore in the Lords Supper breade dooth not ſignifie bread. All theſe propoſitions be meere par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: and therefore nothing followeth thereof.</p>

                  <p>Whether the Euchariſt remaine a Sacrament out of the vſe thereof: We denie it for theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe, ſeeing Sacraments are actions, they conſiſt onely in vſe and action, that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(1)"/> may bee Sacraments: which action and vſe ceaſing, the Sacrament it ſelfe ceaſeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt doth preſcribe a certaine end and vſe; Eate, drinke. Chriſt inſtituted this vſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(4)"/> for this Sacrament; wherefore, this vſe cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the Sacrament ceaſeth alſo.</p>

                  <head>Contrariwiſe our Aduerſaries doe diſpute.</head>
                  <p>1. When Chriſt pronounced theſe words (This is my body) the Diſciples had not eaten as yet; and yet the words of Chriſt were true then, before they did eate, therefore it was a Sacrament alſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before, and without the vſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If we made the action and vſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to conſiſt in eating and drinking, then
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:2051:143"/>
the argument would follow: but we doe not define that action to conſiſt onely in eating and drinking, but in doing all thoſe thinges, which Chriſt either by his example or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement bids vs doe: as namely, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the bread, to breake, bleſſe, diſtribute and eate it, to giue God thanks, and to ſhew the Lords death. It was not therefore out of the vſe of the Sacrament, when Chriſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the bread to his Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>2. Luke omitteth theſe wordes; Take, eate; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating thereby that the body of Chriſt is in the Euchariſt out of the vſe thereof.</p>

The whole action then is not to bee taken from ſome one of them alone, but iointly and together from them all. 2: They conclude heere any thing of everie thing: for what coherence is? Luke omitted ſome words, therefore he did omit them for
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:2051:144"/>
none other cauſe, but to ſhewe, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament out of his vſe, is neuertheleſſe a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                  <p>3. Chriſt faith: <hi>this is;</hi> he ſaith not; It ſhall bee made my body heereafter, to wit in the eating.</p>

                  <p>It was anſwered a while agoe, that the action and vſe doth not conſiſt in eating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; And therefore in the acte of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the bread is rightly called the bodie of Chriſt, even before the eating; that it ſhall not be needefull to ſay; This ſhall bee made the body of Chriſt. 2, And Chriſt in theſe wordes would ſimply ſay this much: I giue you my body to be eaten.</p>
                  <p>4 If the Euchariſt bee not a Sacrament out of his vſe, it would followe, that not the wordes of Chriſt, but our vſe doth make a Sacrament.</p>

                  <p>Chriſts will (whom wee ought to obey in eating and drinking) maketh the Sacrament, and not our vſe.

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:2051:144"/>
wee doe that, which is commaunded by the wordes of Chriſt. It is therefore a fallacie ſuppoſing that to bee a cauſe, which is none.</p>
                  <p>5. In the Primitiue Church the Deacons were woont to carie parts of the Euchariſt to the ſicke: therefore the Euchariſt remaines a Sacrament out of the vſe.</p>

It is therefore a looſe concluſion from the Sacrament in vſe, to the Sacrament out of his vſe.</p>
                  <p>6. Eccleſiaſticall writers doe report, that ſome were wont to carie the Euchariſt home with them, and to reſerue it.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ,</hi> 1. Wee may not make rules of thoſe things, which happen in caſe of neceſſitie. 2. Neither may we thinke, that thoſe deuout Chriſtians, in that agonie of perſecution did receaue the reſerved Euchariſt without the memorie of Chriſts paſſion, without godly praiers, and giving of thankes. All which ſeeing they belong to the vſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Supper, it may not bee ſaide that they receaved the Sacrament out of the vſe.

               <p n="1">1, Chriſt did not command to offer his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud, but to eate and drinke them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And there is not ſo much as one word in al the action and inſtitution of the ſupper, which might inferre any mention of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
               <p n="3">3, Neither do we reade, that Chriſt offered himſelfe in his ſupper (as if by his owne example hee would inſtitute maſſe) for if hee offered himſelfe to his heauenly

But if he offered not himſelfe in his ſupper (as it is moſt true, he did not) then neither can his example, which wee ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, lay vpon vs the office of ſacrificing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Paul receiued of the Lord the inſtitution of the Euchariſt: but made mention of no ſacrifice at all; which the Apoſtle, (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſeeing hee boaſteth that hee had ſhewed all the councell of God.

               <p>The doctrine of the propitiatorie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(2)"/>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:2051:149"/>
ſacrifice of the Maſſe, dooth twhart the perfect ſatisfaction of Chriſt. For if CHRIST haue ſatisfied for the ſinnes of al men with one ſacrifice once offered, and that propitiation of his bee ſufficient. what neede is there ſo often to iterate a propitiatory ſacrifice in the Maſſe?</p>
               <p n="1">1, Hee (Chriſt, not the maſſe) is the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation or reconciliation, not onely for our ſins, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world, 1, Ioh. 2, 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2, And therefore, vpon the croſſe he cryed; It is finiſhed. Ioh, 19, 30.</p>

               <p>(1) For Chriſt alone could offer himſelfe for a propitiatorie ſacrifice; neither could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man offer vp Chriſt, but hee himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Therefore Popiſh prieſts, vnleſſe they willingly ſay that they are new Chriſts, can not offer a propitiatorie ſacrifice,</p>
               <p n="1">1, Chriſt did it once, when hee offered vp <hi>himſelfe,</hi> Hebr, 7. 27.</p>

2, Not that hee ſhould offer himſelfe often. Heb. 9, 25.</p>
               <p n="3">3, Otherwiſe the maſſe-prieſtes ſhould bee Prieſts after the order of Melchifedech, which agreeth to Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p n="4">4, Neither doth anie man take vnto himſelfe this honour, but hee that is called of God, as was Aaron. So likewiſe Chriſt tooke not to himſelfe this honour, to be made the high Prieſt, but he that ſayd vnto him &amp;c, Thou art a Prieſt for euer after the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Melchifedech, Heb, 5. 4, 5. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>(2) It is repugnant alſo to the doctrine of the Prieſthood of Chriſt, in reſpect of the perfect and plenarie ſacrifice, which is not to be iterated. For herein is the prieſthood of Chriſt oppoſite to the Prieſthood of the olde Teſtament, that the ſacrifices thereof ought to bee iterated, but the ſacrifice of Chriſt had no neede to bee iterated.</p>
               <p n="1">1, Chriſt needed not daily, as thoſe high Prieſts (of the olde Teſtament) to offer vp ſacrifice, for his owne ſinnes, and then
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:2051:150"/>
for the peoples: for that did hee once, when he offered vp himſelfe. Heb. 7. 27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The lawe having the ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with thoſe ſacrifices which they offer yeere by yeere continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſanctifie the commers thereunto: for would they not then haue ceaſed, to haue beene offered, &amp;c. Heb. 10. 1. 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. After hee had ſaide: This is the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I will make with them, &amp;c. and their ſinnes and iniquities will I remember no more. Now where remiſſion of theſe things is, there is no more offering for ſin. Heb. 10. 16. 17. 18.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt by his own bloud entered once into the holy place: and obtained eternall redemption for vs (not ſuch a redemption as is to be iterated every day.) Hebrewes. 9. 12.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Not that hee ſhould offer himſelfe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as the high Prieſt entred into the holy place every yeere with other bloud, (for then muſt he haue often ſuffered ſince the foundation of the world): but now in the end of the world hath hee appeared once
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:2051:151"/>
to put away ſinne by the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And as it is appointed vnto men, Once to die, and then commeth the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So Chriſt was once offred to take away the ſins of many. Heb. 9, 25, 26. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By the which will we are ſanctified, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the offering of the body of Ieſus Chriſt once made Heb. 10. 10.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And every Prieſt (namely of the olde <note place="margin">If our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſay, that they offer the ſame &amp; onely ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt: here let them ſee that there is not granted an iteration of the ſame ſacrifices in the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</note> Teſtament) appeareth daily miniſtring &amp; oft times offereth one maner of ſacrifice, which can never take away ſinnes: but this man, after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſinnes, ſitteth for ever at the right hand of God, &amp;c.

But if Chriſt at length offered himſelfe vpon the altar of the Croſſe, it is falſe, that he offered himſelfe to his Father in his ſupper. 2, The word <hi>facite,</hi> doe, in theſe wordes is referred to a certaine action, that is to the reiterating of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Lords ſupper in the Church, of the bleſſing and diſtributing of the breade and wine, of the eating and drinking, of the remembrancing &amp; ſhewing CHRISTS

By this argument it would follow, that it ſhould bee neceſſarie, not that the Prieſts, but that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould offer himſelfe daily: for not the maſſing ſacrificers but chriſt is the Prieſt for euer. 2, It would follow alſo (ſeeing they preſſe the word <hi>Eternitie</hi> or for euer) that the ſacrifice ſhould remaine to be offered ſtill in the World to come after the laſt iudgment. 3, The Apoſtle ſpeaketh of eternall efficacie and vertue of Chriſts Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, whereby, he one and the ſame to day and yeſterday, hath for euer ſanctified them which were to be ſanctified.

                  <p>15 Melchizedeck was a type of Chriſt: but Melchizedeck offered bread &amp; wine. Gen, 14, 18, Therefore it muſt needes bee, that Chriſt offered his body and bloud in his Supper.</p>
                  <p>Anſ, 1, If it were true, that Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck offered breade and wine, (which yet is not true) nothing els would follow, but that Chriſt offered bread and wine, which our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues would not grant.

There are therfore 4, termes. 2, But neither did Melchizedeck offer, but brought forth (as the Hebrew word ſignifyeth) bread and wine for the refreſhing of Abrahams ſouldiers, as the text doth clearely teach. 3, Neither is Melchizedeck ſayde to bee a type of Chriſt in this, whether offering, or
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:2051:158"/>
bringing forth of breade and wine: But firſt in reſpect of the name of Melchizedeck, the King of righteouſneſſe. Secondly, becauſe hee was King of Salem, and Chriſt is King or Prince of peace. (Iſay, 9, 6.) Thirdly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Melchizedeck was together both a King and a Prieſt, and ſo is Chriſt. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the progenie of Melchiſedeck is not related, ſo is Chriſt a Prieſt for euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of Melchiſedeck (Pſalm, 110. 4) All which, whereas the Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues dooth moſt clearely and diſtinctly ſay, yet it ſaith nothing of the maſſe.

                  <p>16 The text (Geneſ. 14, 18.) ſaith: <hi>for</hi> he was a Prieſt, but it is the office of Prieſts to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſacrifices. Therefore Melchiſedeck then of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered breade and wine.</p>

But this Paul treateth of, that Chriſtians cannot with good conſcience both eate the body of Chriſt at the Lords table, and nevertheleſſe in the banquets of the heathen, eate of thoſe meates, which were offered vnto Idols: for all ſacrifices were not wholly conſumed with fire, but a good part thereof was reſerved for coſtly banquets. And what make theſe
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:2051:159"/>
things for the confirming of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe? 2, Bee it that at their tables, they offered thoſe meates to Devils; how doth it follow, that there muſt needes be an oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the Lords table too? vnleſſe they haue ſome ſtrange Logicke to ſhew (contrarie to the olde receaved axiomes,) that thinges which are compared together, muſt needes agree in euery particular point.</p>
                  <p>18. The body and bloud of Chriſt bee propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie for our ſinnes. In the holy Supper there is the body and bloud of Chriſt: therefore the Maſſe is propitiatorie for our ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The body and bloud of Chriſt is not in the ſacrament, ſaue only ſacramentally and ſpiritually, and therfore cannot be there offered. 2. By the ſame reaſon it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that in euery place where Chriſt was on earth, there ſhould be a propitiatorie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. The vertue and efficacie of Chriſts ſacrifice doth at all times flow from the fleſh of Chriſt, but it was made a propitiatorie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice but once, and that vpon the Croſſe; it is offered and given in the Supper; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved of the beleevers by faith. 3.

                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:2051:159"/>
it is ſaid: The body and bloud are in the Sacrament, in the concluſion: therefore the Maſſe is propitiatorie. Were it granted that their Maſſe were nothing but the Sacrament duly adminiſtred, &amp; that the body of Chriſt were carnally there, yet there would no more follow but this, that in the Maſſe there is that, which is propitiatorie for ſinnes. And if it be propitiatorie in bare being, why nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it to be ſacrificed, that it may be propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatorie.</p>
                  <p>19. The Fathers of the Church called the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt by the name of a ſacrifice: therefore the Maſſe is a ſacrifice.</p>

                  <p>In the Canon, God is requeſted to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that pure ſacrifice of the body and bloud <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(2)"/> of Chriſt, as he did accept the ſacrifice of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:2051:172"/>
and Meſchizedeck. If our Aduerſaries referre theſe words to the olde accuſtomed offerings, they make mockeries, ſeeing this manner is now ceaſed amongſt them: and they pray for that, which is no where. But if they refer them to the preſent ſacrifice of the body and bloud of Chriſt in the maſſe; what is this elſe, but to make interceſſion to the heauenly Father for his Sonne Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Againe how abſurdly is that moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſacrifice of Chriſts own body &amp; bloud, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(3)"/> compared with the ſacrifice of Abel, which, it may be, was a Lambe or a Goate? but theſe witleſſe men make no more reckoning of Chriſts ſacrifice, than of a goate or a Lambe.</p>
                  <p>There is compariſon made with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(4)"/> of Melchizedeck, whereas yet there is <note place="margin">An error in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck, who did not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice but brought forth bred and wine.</note> nothing in Scripture (as hath alreadie beene ſhewed) that Melchizedeck did offer breade and wine. The ſacrifice of Chriſt is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with that ſacrifice which is not, neuer was, and neuer ſhall be.</p>
                  <p>The Canon ſayth that they offer the bread <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(5)"/>
                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:2051:173"/>
of life to the heauenly Father: But where are they bid to offer the breade of life? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we reade nothing in the whole courſe of the ſcripture, but that the bread of life ſhould be eaten, not offered.</p>
                  <p>The Canon is contrarie to the article of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(6)"/> Chriſts aſcenſion, when it commandeth the Angels to carie the hoſte before the face of God to the high altar. What? And did not Chriſt aſcend vnto his Father? And is there neede, that he ſhould now after all appeare before his Father, that he ſhould be caried from the earth aboue to his Father?</p>
                  <p>Againe ſeeing Chriſt is neuer in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(7)"/> bodie abſent from his Father, what do the Angels carie, according to the Canon of the maſſe? if breade, then they commit idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie; if his body, then hath Chriſt two bodies, one whereof is preſent in Heauen with the Father; and the other is now after all, caried from the earth by the Angels.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, that we may not ſeeme heere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(8)"/> to make a large refutation of the Canon, whatſoeuer praiſe, prayer, thankeſgiuing, was wont to be vſed in the primitiue Church

               <p>THE Antichriſt of Rome hath moreover mangled the holy Supper of Chriſt, and hath bereaved the people of the one part or kind of the Supper, namely the Cup; which hee pretendeth to appertaine not to the lay people, but to the Prieſts onely: but wee greatly reproue this mangling of the Supper, as a kinde of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that for moſt iuſt reaſons.</p>
               <p>Becauſe it doth directly oppugne the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred &amp; firſt inſtitution of the Supper by our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(1)"/> Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

4, The true body of Chriſt is not without <note place="margin">Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> bloude, therefore ſeeing the bloude is contained alſo vnder hat kinde, it is ſufficient to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate vnder one kinde onely.</p>
                  <p>Anſwer, 1, This argument deſerueth thunder claps and eternall brimſtone. Chriſt forſooth ſeemeth fooliſh to them who (not conſidering that his bloud was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his bodie) inſtituted vnneceſſary things in his laſt will, as not hauing his wits well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him for feare of death.

                  <p>If that were Paulls meaning, then were it lawfull to communicate with the cup only

without breade which ſeeing our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries denie, they doe thereby expoſe the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this argument to bee derided. 2, Paul when hee deſcribeth the inſtitution of the Supper in its proper place, 1, Corinth, 11, 24. 25, 26, 28. Vſeth no diſiunctiue particle. 3. Our Aduerſaries in running to the Greeke text, doe againſt the councell of Trent, which enioyneth the ould vulgar latine tranſlation of the Bible, to bee helde for authenticall in diſputations, ſo that no man may dare or preſume to reiect it vpon any pretence what ſeeuer. Seſſ, 4, Decret, 2.</p>
                  <p>6 Paul ſaith in the Greeke texte: All wee are Partakers of one breade: and thoſe words (et de vno calice, and of one cup) though they be in the olde tranſlation, yet they are not in the Greeke text. Therefore Paul allowed a Communion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kinde.</p>
                  <p>Anſw, 1, It is a failacie of compoſition and Diviſion, becauſe thoſe wordes are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the entire and perfect reaſoning of Paul, by which words he argueth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde from the communion of the cup, as in the beginning hee did from the communion
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:2051:182"/>
of the breade, ſaying: yee cannot drinke the cup of the Lord and the cuppe of deuills. From theſe words, a man might conclude by the ſame conſequence, as the Papiſts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their authoritie doe, that it were lawfull to communicate with the cup onely without breade.</p>
                  <p>7 Paul ſaith: let vs keepe the feaſt in vnleaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned breade. 1 Cor. 5, 8. There Paul maketh no mention of the cup, inſinuating one kinde onely.</p>
                  <p>Anſ, Paul ſpeakes of the newneſſe of life of the regenerate, by an argument drawen from a rite of the Paſſeouer whereby they abſtained from leauen. This is then an idle &amp; inconſequent reaſon.

                  <p n="1">1, Hee, that ſhall beleeue, and be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, ſhall bee ſaved: but hee, that will not beleeue, ſhall be damned. Mark, 16, 16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2, Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you; hee that heareth my word, and beleeveth in him, that ſent me, hath euerlaſting life, and ſhal not come into condemnation, but hath paſſed from death vnto life. Ioh. 5, 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hee that beleeveth in the ſonne, hath euerlaſting life, and hee that obeyeth not the ſonne, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him: Ioh: 3, 36.</p>

                     <pb n="360" facs="tcp:2051:186"/>
4. He that believeth in him, ſhall not bee condemned: but hee that believeth not, is condemned already: Ioh. 3, 18.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So in the parable (Luke, 16) there are onely two places after death mentioned: euerlaſting life, (wherein was Abraham and Lazarus) and eternall damnation (wherin was the glutton:) neither is there granted any paſſage from the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Chriſt at his comming maketh onely two flockes, to wit, the bleſſed and the damned Matthew: 25: and Chriſt ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the purging of them which are of the meane ſort betwixt the other two, by Purgatorie; whereas notwithſtanding in that congregation of all men, the three ſorts of men, the good, the bad, and thoſe of meane ſort betwixt both, ſhall all appeare before the tribunall ſeate of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7, So Chriſt, did not ſend the Thiefe vpon the Croſſe to Purgatorie (though hee had done many ill deedes), but calleth him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to heaven: Luk, 23, 43:</p>

                  <p n="1">1, He ſaith, the faithfull departed do ſleepe, not they are tormented in purgatorie, ver, 13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2, He ſpeaketh it for our comfort. But there would be no comfort, if we ſhould know that our friends religiouſly departed, were in paine and torments and ſuch as bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame, ver, 13.</p>

                  <p>There bee foure termes in the argument. For the purging from the filth of ſinne in the Antecedent is taken for the iuſtification of faith, whereby all that belieue, are waſhed, are ſanctified, are purified, (1, Cor, 6, 11, 1, Ioh 1, 7. Acts 15, 9.) in the conſequent it is taken for a clenſing in purgatorie, neither knowen to God, nor to the Scriptures. 2, There is more in the Conſequent, than in the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent. For it followeth not: the heires of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life are vncleane, therefore they are purified onely by the fire of Purgatorie, and not by any other means, ſuch as theſe which concurre together are, faith, the bloud &amp; the merite of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Anſ, 1, It is a metaphoricall ſpeach, wherein is deſcribed the deliuerance of all mankinde after they had fallen. It is then a fallacy from a thing ſpoken in part and ſome reſpect, to the ſame abſolutely taken. 2, There be contradictories in this, and the argument going before, if they be vnderſtood of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie. In the former argument, water is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be in purgatorie, in this it is deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there is anie water. 3, If the lake without water bee vrged, let our Aduerſaries knowe, that that place (Luke. 16. 23, 24) is hell, whence is no returning. And ſo it doth not agree to purgatorie neither.</p>

Now that which the Prophet ſayth ſhall not hinder them, that our Aduerſaries do fondly turne into a prerogatiue. 2, The contrary rather followeth from this place, to wit, that both the fruitfull and the barren, the maried and the vnmaried are alike eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of God, if they belieue on the Meſſias, and take holde of the Lords couenant.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch hath ordained ſuch faſts. Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Anſwer, 1, In cuſtomes and indifferent ceremonies for orders ſake, obedience is to be performed to the Church, but not in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of neceſſity and articles of our beliefe, vnleſſe it be vpholden by the authority of the ſcripture, whereof we haue ſpoken in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this booke. Thither we referre the Reader. 2, Neither is that rightly aſcribed to the Church, which is tyrannouſly obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be obſerued of Chriſtians by ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men vnder the name of the Church.</p>
                  <p>2 Hee that is weake, eateth herbes, Rom. 14. 2. Therefore the eating of fleſh may rightly be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden for the weake ones ſake.</p>
                  <p>Anſw, 1, Paul ſpeaketh of thoſe that be weake: but the Church reſpecteth not the weake, but onely their owne tyranny, which they would eſtabliſh by ſuch ſuperſtitious precepts. 2, Paul addeth preſently vpon it, let not him that eateth, deſpiſe him that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:2051:238"/>
not, &amp;c. Now if our Aduerſaries think he ſpoke theſe words of the choiſe and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of meates, why doe they not leaue the vſe of meates in mens libertie? and, why do they not take away the difference betweene him that eateth, and him that eateth not? 3, Seeing Paul ſpeaketh of a thing, which hee leaueth in free choiſe, and our Aduerſaries of a thing not lefte at liberty, this allegation of Paul is impertinent. And there be 4. termes.</p>
                  <p>3 It is good not to eate fleſh, Rom, 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21.</p>
                  <p>Anſ, 1, Paul ſpeaketh of the moderating of Chriſtian liberty, (wherof there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie) which ſeeing our Aduerſaries doe wreſt to the abrogating of Chriſtian liberty, there is more in the concluſion than in the premiſſes, and there is committed the fallacy of taking that abſolutely, which is ſpoken but in part onely. 2, If theſe words of Paul do binde vs to a choiſe of meates, then it will follow, that we muſt not drinke wine neither, For Paul ioyneth theſe together: It is not good to eate fleſh nor to drinke wine. Whence one of the two dooth follow; that either theſe words are alleaged impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:2051:238"/>
or that the Church of Rome doth erre in not forbidding the vſe of wine. The latter our Aduerſaries do not grant. Therefore needs they muſt grant the former.</p>
                  <p>4 If meate offend my brother, I will eate no fleſh while the World ſtandeth that I may not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my brother, 1, Cor, 8, 13.</p>
                  <p>Anſ, 1, Paul doth not ſpeake of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh difference of meates (wherein the vſe of all fleſh generally is forbidden) but of things ſacrificed to idolls. Therefore it is nothing to the purpoſe. 2 Euen this moderating of our liberty, is it ſelfe a temporall precept (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth Acts. 15, 29) the Popes prohibition then, ſeeing it is perpetuall, hath no affinity with this precept of Pauls. And ſeeing there be two termes in this argument, which have equiuocation in them, there ariſe fiue terms</p>
                  <p>5 In the Olde Teſtament there was alwaies a difference made of ſome meates, before and after the floode, and in the time of the law.</p>
                  <p>Anſw, 1, Theſe for the moſt part were ſhadows of things to come. Therfore they be long not to vs in the new Teſtament. 2, Then
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:2051:239"/>
there was an expreſſe commandement of God: which wee doe not onely want in the new Teſtament, but wee haue alſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary commandement of Paul, Coloſſ, 2, 20. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>6 Daniel faſted with choiſe of meates, Dan, 1, 8, and 10, 3.</p>
                  <p>Anſw, 1, This was partly (Dan, 1, 8.) by the commandement, (Leu, 11.) partly of his owne free accord (Dan, 10. 3) and not of ſuperſtition<hi>:</hi> but it was rather a faſt of ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and temperance, all which haue no affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with the popiſh faſte, eſpecially ſeeing Daniel abſtained alſo from wine: which the popiſh Prelates, Prieſts and Monkes, would be loth, I warrant you, to obſerue.</p>
                  <p>7 The choiſe and difference of meates hath ground in ſcripture, Leuit, 11, Deut, 14.</p>
                  <p>Anſwer, 1, They were Leuiticall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, abrogated by God. Acts, 10, 15. By the Apoſtles, Act, 15, 10, 19, 20, &amp;c. By Paul Coloſſ. 2, 16, 17, 20. &amp;c, and (Heb, 13. 9.) 2, And that Leuiticall difference of meates was not in this, whether it were lawefull to eate fleſh or fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="465" facs="tcp:2051:239"/>
Wherefore that Leviticall difference of meates is fondly wreſted to the Popiſh difference and choiſe of meates: and there be fiue termes in this argument.</p>
                  <p>8, The Apoſtles did forbid to eate bloud, or that which was ſtrangled, Act. 15. 29.</p>
                  <p>Anſw. 1, It was a temporall commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the moderating of Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, vnto the edification of the weake; but the Popiſh difference and choiſe of meates doth not moderate, but abrogate Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, neither is it for any weake ones ſake, but for obtaining of tyrannie in the Church. 2; The Apoſtles did not forbid them fleſh at all, but bloud &amp; that which was ſtrangled, which many men at this day alſo by nature thinke abhominable to be eaten. It is nothing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>9 The Nazarites abſtained from certaine meats and drinks, Numb. 6, 3.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. 1. The vowe of the Nazarites did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a certain abſtinence for one ſet time: but heerein it agree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h not with the Popiſh choiſe and difference of meates. 2. It was a Leviticall ceremonie, which ought to ceaſe among Chriſtians. 3, The law of Nazarites
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:2051:240"/>
did forbid the vſe of wine alſo, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our Aduerſaries doe retaine in their faſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. The Rechabites abſtained from wine. Ier. 35. 6. 10.</p>
                  <p>Anſw. 1. They did it not to merite the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God: but they had receaued a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Father, that they might the more eaſily abſtaine from drunkennes &amp; the vices, which follow drunkennes. Neither would their Father preſcribe a law to others, but to his ſonnes. It is then a fallacie taking that abſolutely, which is ſpoken but in part. 2. We diſpute of fleſh and they anſwer of wine:</p>
                  <p>11. It is not read that Chriſt did eate fleſh, but that he did eate bread and fiſh, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Anſw. 1, As if the Paſcall Lambe had not beene fleſh. 2. We ſhould not therefore haue an example to imitate, if it were never ſo plaine, that Chriſt did abſtaine from fleſh. 3. But neither doe we reade, that Chriſt did eate hearbs, nuts, ſpices, nor that he dranke beere. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(3)"/> All theſe therefore ſhall be inhibited Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, if this argument follow.</p>

                  <p>Anſ. 1 By this reaſon all fleſh at all times ſhould be forbidden. 2, That curſe is but in part, namely, that it ſhould be barren, and bring forth thornes and thiſtles. 3, So, ſhould we not eate hearbs neither, which ſpring im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly out of the earth.</p>
                  <p>13. Becauſe fleſh is moſt nouriſhing, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth the pricks of Concupiſcence, wee ought to abſtaine from fleſh at that time, which is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the taming of our fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Anſwer. 1. Theſe are the precepts which haue a ſhewe of wiſedome in will-worſhip. (Coloſſ. 2, 23) and wine ſhould be forbidden rather than fleſh; as that which inflameth men to Inſt and other vices, as it is ſaid. Prou: 23, 31, 32, &amp;c.</p>

Seeing there is not one onely man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of confeſſion, but diuers, they argue from that which is ſpoken indefinitely to the ſame taken definitely, &amp; from a particular as from an vniverſall: for there is a confeſſion before God; there is a generall confeſſion, there is a particular, before the Miniſters, before the Church, before our brethren, whom we haue offended, &amp;c. All theſe things our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do fondly confound together.</p>
                  <p>4. The Iewes were baptized of Iohn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed their ſinnes; therefore he ſpeaketh of Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular confeſſion. Math. 3, 6:</p>
                  <p>Anſwer. 1, There is more in the concluſion than in the Premiſſes: for it followeth not; they confeſſed themſelues to be ſinners ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they confeſſed every one of their ſinnes on the Popiſh manner. 2, The text ſaith, that Ieruſalem &amp; all Iurie, &amp; all the region about Iordan went out vnto Iohn, &amp;c. of how much time then, and how many tenne yeares had
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:2051:248"/>
Iohn neede of, if hee would haue heard the particular and ſecret enumeration of all and every their ſinnes: nothing therefore follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth.</p>
                  <p>5. Chriſt ſaith: Whoſeſoever ſinnes yee remit, they are remitted vnto them: and whoſeſoevers ſinnes yee retaine, they are retained. Ioh. 20, 23. That it may therefore bee knowne what ſinnes ought to be retained, what not; it is needfull there ſhould be a particular enumeration of them.</p>
                  <p>Anſw. 1. There is more in the concluſion than in the Premiſſes: for ſinnes may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, which confeſſe themſelues to be ſinners, &amp; ſeriouſly to repent. Although there be made no particular enumeration of all ſinnes, yet wee keepe a good cuſtome in <note n="*" place="margin">The chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Germanie.</note> our Churches, thinking it meete, that the Miniſter, before he giveth abſolution, ſhould try whether hee that confeſſeth, vnderſtand the doctrine of the acknowledgement of ſin, of Redemption, of Grace, and Iuſtification, &amp;c, But that this ſhould be done by that auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular circumſtantiall enumeration of ſinnes, there is no whit contained in Chriſts words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now as concerning retaining of ſinnes, that belongeth to impenitent ſinners; but we may
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:2051:248"/>
not practiſe it vpon them that confeſſe their ſinnes. What needeth then for this retaining of ſinnes, any enumeration of ſinnes, in them, to whom Chriſt biddeth vs apply the key of looſing? 2, Againſt the Popiſh auricular confeſſion we haue an example of Peter, who having heard the generall and devout confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſinnes of the Iewes, did not ſeeke after particulars any more, but gaue vnto them Abſolution &amp; Baptiſme. Act, 2, 38, 41.</p>
                  <p>6. Chriſt ſaith to the Leaper: goe, ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Anſ. 1. There is not any ſillable in the text concerning any manner of confeſſion. It is then a rope of ſand. 2, The cauſe of ſending him to the Prieſt was not any confeſſion, but for a witneſſe vnto them, that they might not be able afterward to denie or cavill at Chriſts miracles. 3, And at that time, by the cuſtome and commaundement of the law of Moſes; the iudging of leaprous perſons belonged to the Prieſts: which at this day is committed to Phyſitians. Heere then is a fallacie taking that for the cauſe, which is not the cauſe.</p>

                  <p>Anſ: 1, Similitudes proue nothing. 2, Here is great difference &amp; vnlikenes: for it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that the Surgeon doe looke vppon the wounds, becauſe hee ought to apply ſeverall plaiſters according to the diverſitie of the wounds: neither are all plaiſters fit for all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, which in ſpirituall wounds of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not ſo: for there all and every diſeaſe is cured with one &amp; the ſame plaiſter, to wit, the bloud of the ſonne of God<hi>:</hi> 1, Ioh: 1, 7, and 2, 2.</p>
                  <p>8. He that deſireth abſolution, may deceaue the Miniſter, therfore auricular confeſſion is better.</p>
                  <p>Anſw. 1, And hee that confeſſeth may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the Prieſt in auricular confeſſion: fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>9. Acknowledge your ſinnes one to another. Iam. 5, 16.</p>
                  <p>Anſ: 1. It is an argument from a particular, as if it were an vniverſall: for it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that Iames doth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And it is all one with that of Chriſt, concerning reconciling our ſelues with our brother offended. Matth. 5, 23, 24.
